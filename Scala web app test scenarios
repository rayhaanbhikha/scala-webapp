What is it?
- 2 Services which run inside docker containers

The 2 APIs are:
1. User Gateway
2. User Datastore

- Thrift

The 3 endpoints to be tested are;
1. /
2. /filtered
3. /users

Test scenarios:

1. Get: http://localhost:8080/

-  Does not require any headers
-  Response should be: 200 OK
-  Response body should return as:

   {
    "page": "Home Pages"
   }

2. Get: http://localhost:8080/filtered

- Requires "client" header
- With header present:
    - Response should be "200" OK
    - Response body should be:
    {
    "page": "Filtered Page"
    }
- Without header:
  - Response should be "400" Bad Request
  - Response body should return as:

  {
    "message": "Client header is missing"
  }

3. Get: http://localhost:8080/users
-  Does not require any headers
-  Response should be: 200 OK
